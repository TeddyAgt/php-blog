But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind.","id":1713098383},{"title":"Dave and the forest","image":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dzfp90k4a\/image\/upload\/v1713098269\/php-blog-course-assets\/undraw_Walking_outside_re_56xo_aa1bfu.png","category":"technology","content":"Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.","id":1713098384},{"title":"Candy candy","image":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dzfp90k4a\/image\/upload\/v1713098517\/php-blog-course-assets\/undraw_ice_cream_s2rh_gc4onf.png","category":"lifestyle","content":"All he wanted was a candy bar.

The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.","id":1713098695},{"title":"This is important to remember","image":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dzfp90k4a\/image\/upload\/v1713098769\/php-blog-course-assets\/undraw_Warning_re_eoyh_cuyrqp.png","category":"technology","content":"This is important to remember. Love isn't like pie. You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.","id":1713098782},{"title":"One can cook","image":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dzfp90k4a\/image\/upload\/v1713098846\/php-blog-course-assets\/undraw_barbecue_3x93_wlncxw.png","category":"hobbies","content":"One can cook on and with an open fire.

It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.\r\n\r\nThings aren't going well at all with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time. I sure hope that things get better soon.\r\nThe chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it.
